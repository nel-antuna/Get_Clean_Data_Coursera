The programming language used for this assignment is R - version 4.0.2(2020-06-22)

Dataset downloaded from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

More information about variables: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Packages used during this assignment are:
- readr
- tidyverse
- reshape2

The original dataset is separated in several files which includes different sort of information and has been named as follows:
- Features -> variables measured
- Subjects_tr -> list with subjects included in training set
- Labels_tr -> activities measured during training set named by a number
- Measures_tr -> values of the variables measured during training set in seconds
- Subjects_test -> list with subjects included in test set
- Labels_test -> activities measured during test set named by a number
- Measures_test -> values of the variables measured during test set in seconds

The above files are merged into a single documents following these steps:
1.- Two datasets are created with the training set information and the test set information
2.- These two datasets are combined into a single one and named TrainTest
3.- Names of the variables are changed to more descriptive ones

Finally, the resulting dataset is converted into a tidy dataset by melting and casting it
